## [Unreleased]

[Show all code changes](https://github.com/jens-duttke/usage-monitor-for-claude/compare/v1.3.0...HEAD)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Configurable usage alerts when quota exceeds defined thresholds (e.g., 80%, 95%), with separate settings for session and weekly quotas
- Time-aware alert mode (on by default) — suppresses notifications when usage is on track with elapsed time; `alert_time_aware_below` controls up to which threshold this applies, so high thresholds can always fire
- Extra usage section in the detail popup when extra usage is enabled on your account, with automatic currency symbol detection from the system locale (overridable via `currency_symbol` in the settings file)
- Status line in the popup showing when data was last updated and whether a refresh is in progress or failed

### Changed

- Server errors (HTTP 5xx) now show a specific "temporarily unavailable" message instead of the generic HTTP error
- Popup opens immediately with cached data instead of waiting for the API response; errors are shown in the status line while usage bars remain visible
- Popup grows away from the taskbar edge regardless of taskbar position (bottom, top, left, or right)

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Added

- Optional settings file (`usage-monitor-settings.json`) to customize polling intervals, popup colors, and icon colors

### Changed

- The code has been split into smaller, focused modules. Running from source now uses `python -m usage_monitor_for_claude`

### Fixed

- No longer sends repeated API requests after a 401 auth error; polls only re-read the credentials file until the token actually changes

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added

- Tray icon supports the Windows light theme
- Session expiry detection with distinct "C!" tray icon when the Anthropic API returns HTTP 401, instead of showing a generic error
- Windows toast notification when quota resets after near-exhaustion (session >95% or weekly >98%), so users know Claude is available again without manually checking
- Adaptive polling that aligns to imminent quota resets for near-immediate feedback when quota refreshes
- Simplified Chinese (zh-CN) and Traditional Chinese (zh-TW) translations

### Changed

- Reassigned tray icon symbols for clearer meaning: "✕" for depleted quota, "!" for errors, "C!" for expired session

### Fixed

- Updated repository URL in setup instructions
